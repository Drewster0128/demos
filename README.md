CS 442 Lecture Repository
-------------------------

This repository contains lecture sample and demo code for CS 442: Mobile
Application Development.

I will likely be making changes to these files throughout the semester, so
please be sure to pull the most recent changes before attending lecture. To
avoid merge issues, I recommend you create a separate branch for your own
additions and modifications so that you can always pull my changes into a
pristine local branch.
