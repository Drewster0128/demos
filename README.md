CS 442 Demo Repository
----------------------

This repository contains demo code for CS 442: Mobile Application Development.

I will be making plenty of changes and additions to this repository throughout
the semester, so please be sure to pull frequently. To avoid merge issues, I 
recommend you create a separate branch for your own modifications so that you 
can always pull my updates into a pristine local branch.
